## Project:
This is a remake of the classic game Space Invaders, originally release in 1978 to Arcade and later released to other platforms.

### How to play:
Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player controls a spaceship horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. <br>
The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. Avoiding to be destroyed first.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.

## Next steps:
> I'm going to implement improvements to make the game adapt its size responsively to different screens and devices.<br><br>
> I have planned to implement in this application improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be played properly by everyone! <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image.
